# AI Face Recognition System

A sophisticated real-time face recognition system built with Python, OpenCV, and CustomTkinter. This application provides a modern GUI interface for face detection, recognition, and management with high accuracy and real-time performance.

## üåü Features

- **Real-time Face Detection & Recognition**
  - Advanced human face detection using Haar Cascade Classifiers
  - Eye detection verification to ensure only human faces are processed
  - Real-time confidence score display
  - High-accuracy LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) Face Recognition

- **Modern User Interface**
  - Full-screen capable interface
  - Window control buttons (Minimize, Maximize, Exit)
  - Live video feed display
  - Intuitive controls for face capture and recognition

- **Smart Face Processing**
  - Automatic face data management
  - Multiple face detection and recognition
  - Confidence score display for recognition accuracy
  - Organized dataset storage system

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-face-recognition.git
   cd ai-face-recognition
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- CustomTkinter
- Pillow

## üíª Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python face_recognition_opencv.py
   ```

2. **Controls:**
   - Press `ESC` to exit fullscreen mode
   - Use window control buttons for minimize, maximize, and close
   - Enter name and click "Capture Face" to add new faces
   - Click "Start Recognition" to begin face recognition

3. **Adding New Faces:**
   - Enter the person's name in the text field
   - Ensure good lighting and face positioning
   - Click "Capture Face" to save
   - Multiple angles recommended for better recognition

## üéØ Key Features Explained
